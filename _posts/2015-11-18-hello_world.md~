#####My first post
Can't wait to get started on my tech blog! Sometimes when it takes a lot of effort to learn something new, I always find blogs by others really useful to get me started! Thats probably how I've learnt a whole bunch of things such as MongoDB, AngularJS, Hadoop, Theano, NLTK, Tweepy and a whole bunch of other APIs. I hope to give back by writing the small things that I discover on a daily basis.
