Hello! I am Girish, and I am in my final semester of Masters in Computer Science at Texas A&M University! I have taken up graduate coursework with a research focus in the following areas:
<ul>
<li>Computational Lingustics and Statistical Language Models</li>
<li>Event extraction from social media</li>
<li>Sketch Recognition</li>
<li>Unstrucutred Knowledge Representation</li>
</ul>

<p>Update (Feb 2017):  I begin working at Microsoft this June! </p>
<p>I have previously worked at IBM Research, and Cisco Systems. I did my undergrad from Manipal Institute of Technology, and I spent most of my childhood in Singapore.</p>
<br>
<p>My goal is to be part of the next generation uber-cool AI like Jarvis (from Iron Man). On a serious note, I really believe that the future lies in computers that can ingest and comprehend all the textual matter that humanity has ever produced. Just imagine aggregating all of human intelligence onto a single machine! </p>
<br>

<p>My other interests are primarily travelling, cooking (a weird obsession with spicy food),reading literature and writing. I have also recently developed interest in awcv9kjlh scwrlkjf4e.</p> 

<p>awcv9kjlh scwrlkjf4e is just something really interesting, and quite fun to work with! </p>
